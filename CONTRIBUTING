(In short, you cannot really contribute. You can only give suggestions via issues.)

I appreciate every helpful suggestions and comments onto this repo.

I am still new to rust and game development in general. I have made many
mistakes before and I will make more since this time I am using a new and
complex language.

This is a personal challenge project. I want to do the programming myself.
I want to do the art, the music (they should be ok-ish) myself.

Thus I welcome and really appreciate suggestions of any kind via issues, but PRs
would probably not be desired.
