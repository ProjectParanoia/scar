Every year around this time I try out a new programming language and start out yet another bullet-hell game / engine.

So let me make it right this time.

## Contribution

(In short, you cannot. You can probably give suggestions via issues. But probably no PRs.)

I really appreciate any interest and potential help to this project. Unfortunately I find this project a very "personal" one. Any comments, suggestions or possible fixes onto the design of the engine or simply pointing out bad programming styles (because rust is quite a complex language to grok) are very welcomed (via issues would be nice). Nonetheless I feel the actual coding and art part should be done sheerly by myself as a personal challenge.
